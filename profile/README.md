# BBJamaat

A friend group that formed while studying CS/AI at the University of Groningen. We all sat in the BernoulliBorg building — so naturally, BB. Jamaat means collective. Hence, BBJamaat.

Started by [@nomomon](https://github.com/nomomon) with the idea of shared projects — helping each other, helping the masjid, that sort of thing. Didn't really work out as a group effort, but a few things came out of it.

One of the first things I made was an app to check when a room in BB had no classes scheduled, so we could find a spot to pray. Eventually we found a permanent room apart from lecture halls (ngl, some of those rooms were so nice cause they also had a sink).
